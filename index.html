    <p>Hello, our names are Madison and Katherine, and welcome to our page! We are two best friends that decided to create a business together! So here we are today, as MadKatCreationz! We love what we do, and we are super excited about the amazing opportunities and adventures this business will bring to us! We are currently based out of Spokane, Washington but love to travel and take our passion with us wherever we go!</p>

    "Their pictures are better than a lot of photographers who may be considered professionals. Plus they're a lot of fun to be around and they're two of the best people I know. I would recommend them to anyone. Not only would get back amazing pictures, you'd have lots of fun during the shoot. They're both very fun and bright beautiful people ❤❤❤
